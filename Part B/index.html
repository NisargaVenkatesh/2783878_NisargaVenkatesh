            <h3>Nagara</h3>
            <main><p>A Nagara temple generally rests on a high platform- jagati over which is constructed a small platform called pitha. Rising above this is a smaller platform- adhisthana, which forms the base for the construction of superstructure of the temple. Among the other components of a Nāgara temple are – bhadra, sirsa, amalaka, bijapuraka, rathika.
              When it comes to decorating the temples, the Nāgara temples are intricately ornamented by carvings and sculptures. The entrance to the temple is highly decorated with images of gods and goddesses, floral and geometric designs. The bottom of the door frame depicts either dvarapalas or Ganga and Yamuna. On the walls and pillars of the temple, the sculptures and carvings depict devakanyas, apsaras, yaksas, yaksis, amalakas and floral garlands..

            <h3>Vesara</h3>
            <main>
              <p>Vesara type adopted from both in variety of ways. Consequently, one might notice a temple with square body at various talas but shikhara and griva to be circular, octagonal or apsidal. Similarly, the body might be oblong but the shikhara and griva could be elliptical. The distinction in this style is in the plan on which the temple’s superstructure is created.
                 It is circular, ellipsoidal or apsidal from the foundation to the pinnacle.The temples of the South are adorned with beautiful and elaborate decorative elements. The carvings of the sculpture are the first thing that catches your eyes. The decoration on the prastara goes around the entire structure just like a hara (garland) would and contains miniature vimana like shrines. 
                 The sculptures depended upon the deity to which the temple was dedicated to.
